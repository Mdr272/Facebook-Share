DESCRIPTION

If you’re trying to make a share button (also called a ‘Feed Dialog’), there’s a long complicated way with JavaScript, great for finer control, but if you want something quick and simple you can just build a normal, one-line, link. This code helps to build one for you.
There is a JavaScript version of the code, and a PHP equivalent.

There is minimal error checking and input validation.
